1. Write out a generic SELECT statement.

	SELECT size, type
	FROM pizza
	WHERE size LIKE 'Large%'
	AND type NOT anchovy;


2. Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.

  Hey! We can SELECT the 'toy' FROM the 'bucket' WHERE the 'toy' is LIKE a dear old trumpet. (I tried).


3. Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:

Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column may have multiple words (for example, "Labrador Collie mix").


  - Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.

  	SELECT name, gender, age
  	FROM dogs
  	WHERE breed='labrador';

    Result:

	name	gender	age
	
	Marley	M	0



  - Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.

	SELECT id
	FROM dogs
	WHERE age < 1;

  Result:

	id
	
	10002
	10004


  - Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.

	SELECT name, age
	FROM dogs
	WHERE gender='F' and weight > 35;

  Result:

	name	age
	
	Boujee	3


  - Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.

  	SELECT *
	FROM dogs
	WHERE breed NOT LIKE '%shepherd%';

  Result:

	id	name	gender	age	weight	breed	intake_date	in_foster
	
	10001	Boujee	F	3	36	labrador poodle	2017-06-22T00:00:00.000Z	null

4. Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?


  - SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;

	name	adoption_date
	
	Mushi	2016-03-22T00:00:00.000Z
	Seashell	null
	Azul	2016-04-17T00:00:00.000Z
	Victoire	2016-09-01T00:00:00.000Z
	Nala	null


  - SELECT name, age FROM cats;

	name	age
	
	Mushi	1
	Seashell	7
	Azul	3
	Victoire	7
	Nala	1


5. From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.


  - Display all the information about all of the available cats.

	SELECT *
	FROM cats
	WHERE adoption_date=null;


  - Display the name and sex of all cats who are 7 years old.

	SELECT name, gender
	FROM cats
	WHERE age=7;

  Result:

	name	gender
	
	Seashell	F
	Victoire	M



  - Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.

	SELECT DISTINCT name
	FROM cats;

  Result:

	name
	
	Azul
	Seashell
	Nala
	Mushi
	Victoire



6. List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.


  - If you can’t list these from memory, do these flashcards until you can!

  = Means that the value is equal to, or the same as the what you're searching for. Like, my name='Jared'

  < or > are the less than and greater than signs. So you can search for my age with this. Example: my age is <
  100

  <= Is less than or equal too. My age is <= 100 and or >= is greater than or equal to. My age is >= 100.

  != Means it isn't equal to the value. My name != 'Jeff Probst'. 

  LIKE allows you to search for things less strictly with the aid of %. My name is LIKE 'J%' will return names
  with the letter 'J' in the beginning. 

  AND will return look for two values and return what has both of those values. My name='Jared' AND handsome.

  OR will return the values with either of the two you want, but not exclusively. Looking for my name='Jared' OR
  handsome, would return me and 'Jeff Probst'.

  NOT will help you hone down your search by looking for things other than what is followed by NOT. Looking for
  name NOT LIKE 'Jared' will return good ol' 'Jeff Probst'.
